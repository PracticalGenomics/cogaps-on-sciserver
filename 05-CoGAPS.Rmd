## Instructions

*Start up a "CoGAPS RStudio" compute container*

1. Open [sciserver.org](https://sciserver.org) in a web browser and log in to your account.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. If you're already logged in, click "**Home**" in the top menu bar to return to the home page.

2. Scroll down to the second set of boxes and click "**Compute**".

3. Click "**Create container**"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Give your container a name. This can be anything you like, but it’s useful if it says something about the purpose of the container so that you can tell your containers apart. You could name this container “CoGAPS”, since you’ll be using it to run CoGAPS.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. In the “**Compute Image**” drop-down menu, select “**R [version #] (RStudio)**” (there may be multiple versions of R in this drop-down menu; click on the latest version listed).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Click "**Create**". This may take a moment.

4. You should now see a new entry in your list of containers.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. "Created at" should be a few moments ago.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. "Name" should be the name you chose.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. "Image" should be "R[version #](RStudio)"

5. Start your CoGAPS RStudio container by clicking on its **name** (whatever name you chose when you created the container). This will open in a new tab.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. You should see RStudio.

![RStudio Screen](/resources/images/RStudio.png)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. If you see something else, you may have picked the wrong "Compute Image" from the drop-down menu.

**If anything goes wrong, you can always delete your container by clicking the red “X” in the last column, and create a new container.**

*Update rlang*

1. Enter and run these commands into RStudio to make sure that you have the current version of ```rlang``` (you will receive an error later on otherwise):

```{r}
packageVersion("rlang") # ‘1.0.6’
devtools::install_github("r-lib/rlang")
packageVersion("rlang") # ‘1.1.0.9000’
```

2. Once you see the output: ```{r} [1] '1.1.1.9000'``` rlang has been updated.

*Install Packages*

1. Enter and run this command:

```{r}
devtools::install_github("FertigLab/CoGAPS")
```

2. This <u>will</u> take a while. Once the red "STOP" symbol is no longer visible in the top right hand corner of the Console, the installation is complete.

3. Enter and run this command:

```{r}
devtools::install_github("sjmgarnier/viridis")
```

4. Once the red “STOP” symbol is no longer visible in the top right hand corner of the Console, the installation is complete.

5. Enter and run this command:

```{r}
remotes::install_github("satijalab/seurat", "seurat5", quiet = TRUE)
```

6. This <u>will</u> take a while. Once the red "STOP" symbol is no longer visible in the top right hand corner of the Console, the installation is complete.

*Load Packages*

1. Enter and run these commands:

```{r}
library( "CoGAPS" )
library( "Seurat" )
library( "viridis" )
```

2. Once the red “STOP” symbol is no longer visible in the top right hand corner of the Console, the packages have been loaded.

*Load Data*

1. Enter and run this command:

```{r}
url <- "https://github.com/FertigLab/CoGAPS/raw/master/data/inputdata.Rds"
download.file( url, "inputdata.Rds" )
```

2. You should see this output if the run is successful:

```{r}
trying URL 'https://github.com/FertigLab/CoGAPS/raw/master/data/inputdata.Rds'
Content type 'application/octet-stream' length 433262849 bytes (413.2 MB)
==================================================
downloaded 413.2 MB
```

3. Enter and run this command:

```{r}
pdac_data <- readRDS( "inputdata.Rds" )
pdac_data
```

4. You should see this output if the run is successful:

```{r}
An object of class Seurat 
15184 features across 25442 samples within 2 assays 
Active assay: originalexp (15176 features, 2000 variable features)
 1 other assay present: CoGAPS
 5 dimensional reductions calculated: PCA, Aligned, UMAP, pca, umap
```

5. Enter and run this command:

```{r}
pdac_epi_counts <- as.matrix( pdac_data@assays$originalexp@counts )
```

6. You should see this output if the run is successful:

```{r}
Warning: sparse->dense coercion: allocating vector of size 2.9 GiB
```

*Configure CoGAPS*

1. Enter and run this command:

```{r}
pdac_params <- CogapsParams(
  nIterations=100,          # run for 100 iterations 
  seed=42,                  # for consistency across stochastic runs
  nPatterns=8,              # each thread will learn 8 patterns
  sparseOptimization=TRUE,  # optimize for sparse data
  distributed="genome-wide" # parallelize across sets
)
```

2. Enter and run this command:

```{r}
pdac_params <- setDistributedParams( pdac_params, nSets=7 )
```

3. You should see this output if the run is successful:
```{r}
setting distributed parameters - call this again if you change nPatterns
```

*Run CoGAPS*

1. Enter and run this command:

```{r}
Sys.time()
```

2. Your output should include today's date and time.

3. Enter and run this command:

```{r}
pdac_epi_result <- CoGAPS( pdac_epi_counts, pdac_params )
```

4. You should see this output if the run is successful (This <u>will</u> take a while, most likely around 20+ minutes):

```{r}
